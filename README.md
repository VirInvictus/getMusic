Requires mutagen to run.

Run:
```pip install mutagen```

This was created out of a necessity when I began managing my large (5000+ song) libraries in foobar2000 rather than relying on MusicBee or MediaMonkey or iTunes. I use foobar2000's quicktagger component to rate each song. The library is in the format of **~\music\ARTIST NAME\ALBUM NAME** and the script relies on that structure to formulate the outpout .txt file.

Currently takes about 1 minute to write about 6000 songs.
