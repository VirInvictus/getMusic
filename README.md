Requires mutagen to run.

Run:
```pip install mutagen```

This was created out of a necessity when I began managing my large (5000+ song) libraries in foobar2000 rather than relying on MusicBee or MediaMonkey or iTunes. I use foobar2000's quicktagger component to rate each song. The library is in the format of **~\music\ARTIST NAME\ALBUM NAME** and the script relies on that structure to formulate the output .txt file.

You do not need to specify the directory if the file is sitting in your music library. It will automatically check every subdirectory for both options with no arguments.
