# Lattice — Patch Notes

## v4.3.1 (2026-04-13)

---

### Bug Fixes
- **Album Overcounting Fix:** Resolved an issue where tracks in "Various Artists" or soundtrack directories were being counted as separate albums. All library generation modes (`--library`, `--ai-library`, `--all-wings`, `--ai-wings`) now correctly group tracks by their containing directory.
- **Improved Metadata Consolidation:** For each directory, the toolkit now automatically determines the most frequent artist, album title, and genre to use for headers, ensuring accurate representation even when track-level tags vary.

---

## v4.3.0 (2026-04-13)

---

### New Features
- **AI Wings:** Added `--ai-wings` to generate separate, token-efficient library files for each genre. These files hide individual songs and only include Artist, Album, Genre, and Directory Location, making them ideal for large-scale LLM processing or quick library overviews.
- **TUI Submenu Expansion:** The Library Tree & Exports submenu now includes both "Generate AI wings" and the previously omitted "Generate smart playlist" options.

---

## v4.2.2 (2026-04-13)

---

### Bug Fixes
- **TUI Persistence Fix:** Fixed an issue where the TUI would exit or "blink" back to the menu when running background tasks (like Stats). This was caused by the progress bar calling `curses.endwin()`, which terminated the curses session prematurely.
- **Improved Progress Bar:** The TUI progress bar now correctly updates within the existing curses session without corrupting the terminal state.

---

## v4.2.1 (2026-04-13)

---

### Bug Fixes
- **Stats Page Fix:** Fixed a `NameError` in the statistics module where `genre_ratings` was not properly initialized.
- **Missing Report:** Properly implemented the "Rating Distribution per Genre" report section in `--stats` which was previously omitted.
- **Version Synchronization:** Corrected version mismatches across the repository.

---

## v4.2.0 (2026-04-13)

---

### Major Overhaul: Configurable Layout & Smart Playlists

Lattice now supports dynamic directory structures via the `--layout` flag, completely decoupling library generation from the strict `ARTIST/ALBUM` assumption. You can now generate `.m3u` playlists using rule-based filters.

### New Features & Improvements
- **Configurable Layout:** A new `--layout` argument specifies your directory structure (e.g. `{genre}/{artist}/{album}`). `write_music_library_tree`, `write_ai_library`, and `write_all_wings` now intelligently parse paths according to this structure if tags are missing. They no longer fail or produce garbage output on flat folders.
- **Smart Playlists:** Generate `.m3u` playlists based on dynamic evaluation rules using `--playlist` and `--rule` (e.g. `"rating >= 4 and genre == 'Jazz'"`).
- **WAV & WMA Support:** Extended the unified FFmpeg decode scanner to verify WAV (`--testWAV`) and WMA (`--testWMA`) files.
- **Art Quality Audit:** Added `--auditArtQuality` (with configurable `--min-art-res`) to parse and report extracted or embedded covers falling below a minimum resolution threshold (default: 500x500).
- **Bitrate Floor Audit:** Added `--auditBitrate` (with configurable `--min-bitrate`) to report audio files falling below a designated kbps floor (default: 192).
- **Rating Distribution per Genre:** The library statistics page (`--stats`) now cross-tabulates rating distributions (e.g., 5-star vs 1-star spread) independently per genre.

### Bug Fixes
- **TUI Close Button Fix:** Fixed an indexing error in the interactive menu where selecting "Quit" would accidentally trigger the "Change library root" prompt due to a missing settings group in the main `_MAIN_SECTIONS` list.

---

## v4.1.3 (2026-04-12)

---

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue in the TUI main menu where selecting "Quit" (or pressing 'q') would unintentionally trigger the "Change library root" prompt due to a mismatched menu array index.

---

## v4.1.2 (2026-04-12)

---

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Fully Immersive TUI:** Addressed an issue where background operations (such as cover art extraction or tree generation) would write their output directly to the terminal stdout and pause, which dropped the user out of the full-screen curses environment.
  - The TUI now features a global output capture wrapper (`_run_with_capture`) using an `io.StringIO` buffer.
  - Standard output and error output are automatically intercepted while a background task executes, allowing progress bars to draw undisturbed.
  - Upon task completion, any logged output (e.g., dry-run details, success messages, errors) is formatted and displayed within the `_tui_page` viewer, ensuring the user never leaves the curses application.

---

## v4.1.1 (2026-04-12)

---

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a rendering bug where `_TUIPbar` did not erase the screen on its first draw, causing overlapping text from previous prompts in the curses interface.
- Fixed a crash (`ValueError: embedded null character`) when scrolling through the library statistics TUI page by sanitizing null bytes from the output report.

---

## v4.1.0 (2026-04-12)

---

### New Features & Improvements
- **First-Run Configuration:** Added a persistent configuration file stored at `~/.config/lattice/config.json`.
  - The CLI and TUI now save the root music library location upon first run, eliminating the need to repeatedly specify `--root` or manually enter the path in the interactive menu.
  - A new "Change library root" option has been added under the `SETTINGS` section in the TUI main menu.
  - If no `--root` is provided, the CLI gracefully falls back to the configured location (or prompts if unconfigured).
- **TUI Immersion Enhancements:**
  - Progress bars now render seamlessly inside a stylized curses box when running from the TUI, preventing screen tearing and keeping the interface consistent.
  - The library statistics page now displays its full report in an integrated, scrollable curses pager (`_tui_page`), rather than dropping you back into standard terminal output.

---

## v4.0.2 (2026-04-12)

---

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **PyInstaller Multiprocessing Fix:** Fixed an issue where the standalone binary would crash (`unrecognized arguments: -B -S -I -c`) on Python 3.14 due to the `multiprocessing.resource_tracker` trying to spawn a new process using the executable as the Python interpreter. The executable now properly intercepts `-c` command strings from the tracker.
- **Positional Root Argument:** The CLI now supports providing the root directory as an optional positional argument. You can run commands like `lattice --library .` instead of explicitly using `--root .`.

---

## v4.0.0 (2026-04-11)

---

### Major Overhaul: Package Restructure & Standalone Binary

Lattice has been completely refactored from a single ~2500-line monolithic script (`Lattice.py`) into a proper, modern Python package architecture.

**Layer-Based Package Design.** The codebase is now housed in `src/lattice/` and split by logical functionality (`cli.py`, `tui.py`, `tags.py`, `utils.py`, `config.py`, and a `modes/` directory for individual feature operations). This dramatically improves maintainability while preserving the exact same functionality and CLI interface.

**Modern Build System (Hatch).** Lattice now uses `pyproject.toml` managed by Hatch, replacing the need for manual `pip install mutagen tqdm` commands. You can now cleanly install Lattice via `pipx install .` and have the `lattice` command available globally in your terminal.

**Standalone Native Executable.** We have integrated **PyInstaller** support to compile Lattice into a self-contained standalone binary. This means end-users no longer need to install Python or external packages (like `mutagen`) on their machines. The compiled binary (`lattice`) can be dropped into any directory in your PATH.

---

## v3.1.0 (2026-04-09)

---

### Enhancements

**Absolute Paths for Genre Wings.** The `--all-wings` mode now accepts a `--paths` flag. When enabled, the absolute directory path is appended to the album header in the generated text files (e.g., `ALBUM: Jane Doe [/path/to/Music/Converge/Jane Doe]`). 
- This bridges the gap between visualization and execution. It eliminates the need to write brittle shell scripts that guess file locations by scraping artist and album strings. You can now pipe the generated wing files directly into command-line tagging utilities.
- The interactive TUI's Library submenu has been updated to prompt for path inclusion (`Include paths? (y/N)`) when generating genre wings.
**Companion Script: `retag.py`.** Added a standalone universal genre tagger to the repository. It abstracts away container-specific tagging differences (ID3, Vorbis, Apple atoms) and is designed to cleanly consume the absolute paths generated by the `--all-wings --paths` flag. This allows for safe, bulk-overwriting of genres at the album-directory level.

## v3.0.1 (2026-04-08)

---

### Bug Fixes

**Album Artist Prioritization.** Fixed an issue where albums were being split up due to featured artists on individual tracks. The tag extractor now consistently prioritizes "Album Artist" over "Artist" across all supported formats:
- MP3: `TPE2` > `TPE1`
- FLAC/Ogg/Opus: `albumartist` > `artist`
- MP4/M4A: `aART` > `\xa9ART`
- ASF: `wm/albumartist` > `author`

---

## v3.0.0 (2026-04-06)

---

### Consistent Full-Screen TUI

The entire interactive experience now stays in curses. Previously, selecting a
menu item dropped to raw `input()` calls for parameter prompts (root directory,
output file, worker count, etc.) and the post-operation pause, breaking the
visual flow. All prompts and the pause screen now render inside the same styled
Unicode boxes as the menus.

**Curses prompts.** `_tui_prompt_str` draws a centered box with a yellow header
label and a cursor-visible input field. Typing, backspace, Enter to confirm,
Esc to accept the default — all within the curses session. Since `_prompt_path`
and `_prompt_int` call `_prompt_str` internally, every parameter prompt in the
interactive menu gets the TUI treatment automatically.

**Curses pause.** `_tui_pause` replaces the raw `input("Press Enter…")` with a
styled box. Accepts Enter, q, or Esc to dismiss.

**Fallback preserved.** If curses is unavailable or stdin is not a TTY,
prompts and pause fall back to plain `input()` — same as before.

All CLI flags (`--library`, `--ai-library`, `--all-wings`, etc.) are unchanged.

---

## v2.4.0 (2026-04-06)

---

### TUI Overhaul: Arrow-Key Navigation

The interactive menu is now a full-screen curses TUI with arrow-key navigation,
color-coded sections, and a highlighted selection cursor (`►`). No more typing
numbers — just `↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` to select, `q` or `Esc` to quit.

The menu is drawn as a centered Unicode box with labeled section groups:
**Library** (yellow), **Integrity**, **Artwork**, and **Metadata**, separated
by ruled dividers. The selected item is highlighted in bold cyan reverse video.
A hint bar at the bottom shows available controls.

**Library submenu.** AI-readable library export and genre wings (all-wings)
are now nested under a "Library tree & exports" submenu (marked with `→`)
alongside the standard library tree builder. Selecting it opens a second
curses menu; `Esc` returns to the main menu. This trims the top-level menu
from 11 flat items to 10 navigable entries and groups the three library-output
modes where they logically belong.

**Curses colors:**
- Cyan box frame
- Bold yellow section headers
- Bold cyan-on-black highlight for selected item
- Dim hint bar

**Fallback path.** If `curses` is unavailable (e.g. `windows-curses` not
installed) or stdin is not a TTY, the menu falls back to a static boxed
text display with numbered options and typed input — same layout, just without
arrow-key navigation.

**Post-operation pause.** Every mode now waits for Enter before redrawing
the menu, so results aren't immediately scrolled off screen.

**Indented prompts.** All interactive prompts are visually aligned with the
menu box for a tighter feel.

All CLI flags (`--library`, `--ai-library`, `--all-wings`, etc.) are unchanged.

---

## v2.3.0 (2026-04-05)

---

### New Feature: Genre Wings

**`--all-wings`** scans genre tags across the entire library, groups albums by
genre, and writes a separate library tree file for each genre into an output
directory — analogous to virtual library wings in Calibre's getBooks.

```bash
lattice --all-wings --root ~/Music --output wings/
```

Produces files like `Alternative_Rock_Library.txt`, `East_Coast_Rap_Library.txt`,
etc. Albums with no genre tag land in `Uncategorized_Library.txt`. Each file
uses the same tree format as `--library`. Pass `--genres` to include the genre
label in album headers. Available from both CLI and interactive menu (option 11).

### AI Library: Removed Album Artist Fallback

The `--ai-library` export no longer overrides the directory-based artist name
with tag data. Previously, the artist field fell back through TPE1 → TPE2
(ALBUMARTIST) from tags, which added noise without value — the AI export
doesn't distinguish album artist from track artist, and the directory name is
the canonical artist in a well-organized library. This keeps the output cleaner
and more predictable.

---

## v2.2.0 (2026-04-05)

---

### New Feature: AI-Readable Library Export

**`--ai-library`** generates a flat, token-efficient summary of the music
library for use in LLM recommendation prompts. One line per album in
pipe-delimited format:

```
Artist | Album | Genre | Rating | Tracks
--------------------------------------------------
Converge | Jane Doe | Metalcore | 4.8 | 12
```

- **Rating** is the average of all rated tracks in the album, rounded to one
  decimal. Blank if no tracks are rated.
- **Tracks** is the number of audio files surviving in the album directory —
  the post-cull headcount. An AI reading `5.0 | 1` vs `4.6 | 12` gets the
  density signal without extra framing.
- Genre is sampled from the first track with a genre tag.
- Output defaults to `library_ai.txt`. Available from both CLI and interactive
  menu (option 10).

### Performance

**`get_all_tags` reduced to a single `MutagenFile` open per file.** The v2.1.0
unified reader still opened each file twice — once via the EasyID3 abstraction
pass, once via the full format-specific path (because rating, duration, and
bitrate aren't available through the easy interface). The easy pass is now
eliminated entirely; all tag extraction runs against the single full object.
The MP3 branch also had a separate `ID3(file_path)` call on top of the
`MutagenFile` open — removed, tags are read from `audio.tags` directly.

On a 6,300-track library, this eliminates ~12,600 redundant file opens per
full-library mode.

**`TagBundle` extended with `duration_s` and `bitrate_kbps`.** These fields are
extracted from `audio.info` during the same single open. `run_stats` previously
opened every file a second time just to read duration and bitrate — that
redundant open is gone.

**First-song double-read eliminated in `--library --genres`.** Genre was read
from the first song before the per-track loop, then the loop re-read the same
file. The album header is now deferred until the first track's tags are available
inside the loop.

**`count_audio_files` was called twice in `--ai-library`.** Once for the console
message, once for the progress bar. Now called once, result reused.

**`_has_embedded_art` duplicated `_extract_best_art`'s directory scan logic.**
Collapsed to a one-liner: `return _extract_best_art(directory) is not None`.

**Low-quality bitrate count in `--stats`** used a list comprehension just to
call `len()`. Replaced with a generator sum.

### Bug Fixes

**`--root ~/Music` didn't work from the CLI.** `main()` was missing
`os.path.expanduser()` — tilde expansion only worked in the interactive menu.

**`--library --output subdir/file.txt` crashed.** `write_music_library_tree`
opened the output file directly without creating parent directories, unlike
every other mode. Added `os.makedirs`.

**`_find_files_by_ext_path` matched false extensions.** Used
`filename.endswith('.flac')` which would match a hypothetical file named
`notflac`. Replaced with `os.path.splitext` for exact extension matching.

**Rating bucketing in `--stats` used Python's `round()` (banker's rounding).**
A 4.5 rating rounded to 4, but so did 3.5. Replaced with `int()` (truncate)
for consistent behavior matching the star display logic in `format_rating`.

### Structural Improvements

**Unified MP3/Opus decode scanner.** `_scan_one_mp3`, `_scan_one_opus`,
`run_mp3_mode`, `run_opus_mode`, and `_format_mp3_meta` collapsed into three
shared functions: `_scan_one_file`, `_run_decode_scan`, and `_format_row_meta`.
Format-specific behavior is parameterized via `ext`, `enrich`, and
`ffmpeg_required` flags. Adding a new format is now a three-line wrapper.

**`_FallbackProgress` class replaces all `if pbar:` conditionals.** `_make_pbar`
now always returns an object with `.update()` and `.close()`, whether tqdm is
installed or not. Eliminated 6 conditional blocks and 4 dead counter variables
(`current_file`, `checked`, `scanned_count`, `current`) that existed only to
feed the manual fallback.

**`is_audio()` helper.** Replaced 6 inline
`os.path.splitext(f)[1].lower() in AUDIO_EXTENSIONS` patterns. Two callsites
where `ext` was already extracted for other purposes were left as-is.

**`_looks_numeric()` helper.** Replaced 4 inline
`str(val).replace('.', '').isdigit()` patterns in rating extraction code.

**`_prompt_path()` helper.** Consolidated 8 identical
`os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(_prompt_str(...)))` patterns in the
interactive menu.

**`test_flac` simplified.** Two mirrored if/elif branches (one per tool
preference) collapsed into a priority-ordered tool list with a single loop.

### Dead Code Removed

**Four standalone tag functions removed (~190 lines).** `get_title_artist_track`,
`get_album`, `get_genre`, `get_rating` — all superseded by `get_all_tags` in
v2.1.0 but left in the codebase. No internal callers remained.

**`_get_cover_file_path`** — defined but never called by any mode.

**`_scan_one_mp3`, `_scan_one_opus`, `_format_mp3_meta`** — replaced by the
unified scanner.

**`ID3` and `ID3NoHeaderError` imports** — no longer needed after the MP3
branch was rewritten to use `audio.tags` from `MutagenFile`.

**Stale `(NEW)` markers** removed from section headers.

---

## v2.1.0 (2026-04-04)

---

### Bug Fixes

**Opus mode wrote to `mp3_scan_results.csv`.** Copy-paste bug in `_write_header`
hardcoded `DEFAULT_MP3_OUTPUT` as the fallback filename for all modes. Opus scans
silently wrote results to the wrong file.

**`_extract_art_from_mp3` called `MUTAGEN_MP3` without checking
`HAVE_MUTAGEN_MP3`.** If `mutagen` installed but `mutagen.mp3` failed to import,
art extraction threw `NameError`.

**`verbose` flag mutated `only_errors` and `quiet` inside the MP3 scan loop.**
Dead writes on every iteration after the first. Moved above the loop. Opus mode
now has the same `verbose` behavior for consistency.

**Terminal corruption after subprocess modes.** Running FLAC/MP3/Opus integrity
checks from the interactive menu left the terminal with `icrnl` disabled — Enter
sent `^M` instead of newline, and input froze. Caused by `run_proc` using raw
bytes mode while `flac -t` wrote binary diagnostic data to stderr, colliding
with tqdm's cursor manipulation. Fixed with `_reset_terminal()` (`stty sane`)
called at the top of every menu loop, and in a `finally` block on CLI exit.

### Structural Improvements

**Unified tag reader: `get_all_tags()` → `TagBundle`.** The old code opened each
file up to 4× via independent `MutagenFile()` calls (`get_title_artist_track`,
`get_album`, `get_genre`, `get_rating`). Consolidated into a single function
returning a `TagBundle` named tuple. ~19,000 fewer file opens per `--library`
run on a 6,300-track library. Callers updated: `write_music_library_tree`,
`run_tag_audit`, `run_duplicates`. Original standalone functions preserved for
any external imports but no longer called internally.

**Duplicate file-finder eliminated.** `find_files_by_ext` (string generator) and
`_find_files_by_ext_path` (Path list) did the same job. Removed the former,
pointed FLAC mode at the latter.

**Vestigial `paths` list removed from `run_mp3_mode`.** Leftover from a
multi-root design that never shipped. Replaced with a plain `root_path`.

**`Counter` import consolidated.** Was at module level via `defaultdict` but then
re-imported locally in `run_tag_audit`. One import, one location.

**Removed unused `Iterable` from typing imports.**

### Output Format: CSV → Formatted Text

All output modes now write `.txt` reports instead of `.csv`. None of these
outputs were destined for spreadsheets — they're checklists and diagnostics
read by one person, and the format now respects that.

- **FLAC/MP3/Opus integrity** — Header with scan totals, results grouped by
  severity (ERRORS → WARNINGS → OK). Relative paths, tool/error details,
  compact metadata where relevant (bitrate, sample rate, duration).
- **Missing art** — Two sections: no art at all, embedded only. Relative paths
  with file counts.
- **Duplicates** — Grouped by artist/album pair with directories nested
  underneath showing format sets.
- **Tag audit** — Grouped by directory, each file showing format and missing
  fields. Header includes field-level breakdown counts.

### Dead Code Removed

**`_write_header` / `_close_writer` / `_rotated_path`** — Entire CSV writer
infrastructure gone. These managed `csv.DictWriter` lifecycle via a
monkey-patched `_file_handle` attribute. With text output, file writes are
straightforward `open()` calls.

**`import csv`** — No longer imported.

---

## v2.0.0 (2026-03-15)

---

Lattice.py is now a single unified toolkit. The standalone
`extract_opus_art.py` and `extract_mp3_art.py` scripts are retired — their
functionality lives in the main script as `--extractArt`, with improvements.

### New Modes

- **`--testOpus`** — Opus file integrity checking via FFmpeg decode (same
  pattern as `--testMP3`).
- **`--extractArt`** — Extract embedded cover art to `cover.jpg` with format
  priority ranking (FLAC > Opus > M4A > MP3) and `--dry-run` support.
- **`--missingArt`** — Report directories with no cover art (distinguishes
  "no art at all" from "embedded only").
- **`--duplicates`** — Detect same artist+album appearing across multiple
  directories or formats.
- **`--auditTags`** — Report files missing title, artist, track number, or
  genre with a summary breakdown.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed cover.jpg collision** — Cover detection is now case-insensitive.
  Running art extraction in a folder with both Opus and MP3 files no longer
  produces both `cover.jpg` and `Cover.jpg`.

### Improvements

- Art extraction prefers front cover (type 3) over generic embedded images.
- Art extraction supports four formats: FLAC, Opus/OGG, M4A, MP3.
- Interactive menu updated with all eight modes.
- All existing CLI invocations remain backward-compatible.

### Removed

- `extract_opus_art.py` (folded into `--extractArt`).
- `extract_mp3_art.py` (folded into `--extractArt`).
les no longer
  produces both `cover.jpg` and `Cover.jpg`.

### Improvements

- Art extraction prefers front cover (type 3) over generic embedded images.
- Art extraction supports four formats: FLAC, Opus/OGG, M4A, MP3.
- Interactive menu updated with all eight modes.
- All existing CLI invocations remain backward-compatible.

### Removed
